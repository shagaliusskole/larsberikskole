        <p>shagalius started off with a playstaion and played fortnite and
            many other games for funn. But after a while he got an x-box and
            started playing competitive with his two team mates slinkymitten
            and landci cuber/landci. After a while of playing he got better
            and better and after a year of playing with a controller he swiched 
            to keyboard and mouse on console. He got better at it fast. He started 
            doing 1v1s with slinkymitten and after a year of keyboard and mouse 
            he started saving for a pc. after doing many practiceses before he 
            got his pc he stopped playing for a while. 
            <p>when he went back to playing he was a little rusty
             but he got better again for the second time after he got used to
            the new season he began playing arena/competitive and tournaments
            he was improving fast but then! he was loosing team mates left
            and right. people were starting to dislike the game and quiting
            he began quiting to but he still had his last two duos left what
            was he going to do now. If they stopped playing he would most
            likley stop to play to but that would not be it he pushed his team mates 
            to not stop playing and it was kind of working and afetra while of pushing his team mates 
            people started playing and then he got his gaming pc he had already played with keyboard and mouse 
            so it was no problem with building. soon everyone had started palying again 
            many of his friends started playing som old and some new to the game. this is 
            when his famous friend Vennlig oppvask joined the game he played on controller/playstation it took a
             while but eventually oppvask got better he was shagaliuses new duo
            but it didnt last long as slinkymitten was back in buisniess
